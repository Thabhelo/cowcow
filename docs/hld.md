# Cowcow High-Level Design

## System Overview

Cowcow is an offline-first data collection platform designed for low-resource language documentation. The system consists of three main components:

1. **Core Library** (`cowcow_core`)
   - Audio capture and processing
   - Quality control metrics
   - Cross-platform audio analysis

2. **Command Line Interface** (`cowcow_cli`)
   - Recording and QC workflow
   - Local storage management
   - Upload queue management

3. **Sync Service** (`server`)
   - Authentication and user management
   - Data upload and storage
   - Reward system backend

## Key Technical Decisions

### Audio Processing
- Use `cpal` for cross-platform audio capture
- Implement VAD using WebRTC's VAD library
- Process audio in 16kHz mono PCM format
- Calculate QC metrics in real-time

### Storage Strategy
- Local: SQLite for metadata, filesystem for audio
- Remote: S3-compatible storage (R2)
- Use gRPC for efficient binary transfer
- Implement chunked uploads with resume

### CLI Architecture
- Rust-based for performance and reliability
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Offline-first with background sync
- Configuration via TOML files

### Security Model
- JWT-based authentication
- TLS 1.3 for all network traffic
- Secure credential storage
- API key management

## Performance Targets

- Audio QC: < 200ms processing time
- Storage: < 160kB per 10s clip
- CLI responsiveness: < 100ms for commands
- Network: Efficient chunked uploads

## Extensibility

- Plugin system for QC metrics
- Configurable sync strategies
- Extensible reward system
- Support for multiple languages

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Structured logging
- Error tracking
- Performance metrics
- Usage analytics
